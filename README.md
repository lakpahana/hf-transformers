# HuggingFace Notes

# HF Transformers

hf transformers is a lib that is build on top of gpt,bert like models so can do NLP tasks easily. from this lib can fine tune already pre trained transformrer

gpt(generative pretrained transformer) types in the hf tf

Encoder-only models (like BERT) understand text and create representations of it.

Decoder-only models (like GPT) generate new text based on given contexts.

Encoder-decoder models (like T5) combine both understanding and generation capabilities to perform tasks like translation or summarization.

# HF Pipelines

from pipelines can use models(inference) without downloading the pre trained models from the hf platform
